    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate market is characterized by significant information asymmetry. Buyers and renters often lack the expertise and market visibility needed to determine whether a listed property price is fair relative to similar properties in the same location. At the same time, sellers and agents may unintentionally overprice or underprice properties due to reliance on intuition, incomplete comparable listings, or outdated market information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pricing inefficiencies can result in prolonged time on the market, failed negotiations, financial losses, and reduced trust in the housing ecosystem. The problem is especially pronounced in urban housing markets, where property prices vary widely based on location, size, property type, and available amenities, making price fairness difficult to assess for non-expert participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than predicting an exact market value, there is a practical need for a **decision-support system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proposes a **supervised machine learning classification system** that learns pricing patterns from historical real estate data and property features such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location\n",
    "- Property type  \n",
    "- Bedrooms, bathrooms, and toilets  \n",
    "- Amenities and listing characteristics  \n",
    "- Listing category (for rent / for sale)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model will classify each property into one of three pricing categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Underpriced** – Listed significantly below comparable market listings  \n",
    "- **Fairly Priced** – Listed within a reasonable range of comparable market listings  \n",
    "- **Overpriced** – Listed significantly above comparable market listings  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating a numeric price estimate, the system focuses on **relative price fairness**, making it more interpretable and directly actionable for users. This approach provides an objective, data-driven benchmark that reduces reliance on subjective judgment and improves pricing transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Classify property listings as underpriced, fairly priced, or overpriced**  \n",
    "  using historical real estate data and supervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Support better pricing decisions for buyers, renters, and sellers**  \n",
    "  by providing a clear and interpretable price fairness label.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.**Improve market transparency in real estate pricing**  \n",
    "  by reducing reliance on subjective pricing judgments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.**Enable scalable pricing analysis across cities and property types**  \n",
    "  through a reusable and retrainable machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Achieve strong classification performance**  \n",
    "  - Overall Accuracy ≥ **75–80%**  \n",
    "  - Macro F1-score ≥ **0.75**  \n",
    "  - Precision and Recall ≥ **0.70** for *underpriced* and *overpriced* classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide interpretable model outputs**  \n",
    "  - Feature importance or explanations available  \n",
    "  - Clear, human-readable pricing labels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buyers & Renters  \n",
    "- Identify good deals and avoid overpriced listings  \n",
    "- Improve negotiation leverage  \n",
    "- Reduce financial risk and search time  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sellers & Property Owners  \n",
    "- Set competitive prices based on market evidence  \n",
    "- Reduce prolonged time on market  \n",
    "- Improve chances of successful transactions  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Estate Agents & PropTech Platforms  \n",
    "- Add an objective, data-backed pricing indicator to listings  \n",
    "- Enhance user trust and platform credibility  \n",
    "- Differentiate platforms with intelligent pricing insights  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy Makers & Urban Planning Analysts (Future Use)  \n",
    "- Analyze housing affordability trends  \n",
    "- Identify spatial price distortions  \n",
    "- Support evidence-based housing policy development  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "This project intentionally reframes the pricing task from a regression problem (predicting an exact market price) into a multi-class classification problem (underpriced, fairly priced, overpriced). While numeric price predictions can be sensitive to noise, outliers, and incomplete feature coverage, especially in heterogeneous housing markets. Stakeholders typically care more about whether a listing is reasonably priced relative to comparable properties than about a precise price estimate. A classification-based approach provides more interpretable, actionable outputs for non-technical users and aligns more directly with real-world decision-making, such as identifying good deals or avoiding overpriced listings. Additionally, class-based labeling is more robust to market volatility and data quality issues, making the system more stable and practical for deployment in real-world real estate platforms."

    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following key variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Information\n",
    "- **price**: The listed price of the property. For rental listings, this typically represents the monthly rent, while for sale listings it represents the asking sale price.\n",
    "- **price_qualifier**: Additional context for the price (e.g., “per month”), primarily relevant for rental listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Characteristics\n",
    "- **bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the property.\n",
    "- **bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.\n",
    "- **toilets**: Number of toilets.\n",
    "- **parking**: Number of available parking spaces.\n",
    "- **furnished**: Binary indicator showing whether the property is furnished.\n",
    "- **serviced**: Indicates whether the property is serviced.\n",
    "- **shared**: Indicates whether the property is shared with other occupants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Classification\n",
    "- **category**: Indicates whether the property is *For Sale* or *For Rent*.\n",
    "- **type**: Broad property type (e.g., House, Apartment).\n",
    "- **sub_type**: More detailed property classification (e.g., Townhouse, Detached Duplex).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Location Information\n",
    "- **state**: County or major administrative region (e.g., Nairobi, Kajiado).\n",
    "- **locality**: Town or area within the county (e.g., Embakasi, Kitengela).\n",
    "- **sub_locality**: More granular neighborhood information where available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing Metadata\n",
    "- **id**: Unique identifier for each listing.\n",
    "- **listdate**: Date the property was listed on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevance to the Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset captures key determinants of property pricing in the Kenyan real estate market, particularly location, property size, and property type. Similar properties within the same locality often display significant price variation, indicating potential pricing inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the dataset well-suited for developing a **pricing fairness classification model** that flags underpriced and overpriced listings to support better market transparency and decision-making."

    "### 8b)Handling Extreme Sale Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Some property listings in the dataset have **unusually low or extremely high sale prices**. These extreme values are rare and can skew the machine learning model if left unadjusted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this:  \n",
    "- We **cap prices** at a realistic range (600,000 KES to 100,000,000 KES) to prevent outliers from dominating the model’s learning process.  \n",
    "- At the same time, we **preserve the original prices** in a separate column so that rare or unusual listings can still be analyzed for **anomaly detection**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach balances **model training** with the ability to **identify pricing anomalies**, which is a key goal of the project.\n"
